## Some details about the App

### **API and HTML entities**

We are using the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) **API** to fetch data for the Quizes.

Example data received from the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) API :

```js
category: "Entertainment: Video Games"
correct_answer: "Champ"
difficulty: "easy"
incorrect_answers: Array(4) [ "Duke", "Snoopy", "Champ"]
question: "In the video game &quot;Postal 2&quot;, what is the name of Postal Dude&#039;s dog?"
type: "multiple"
```

If you look at the `question` key, you will see that in its value it has something like `&quot;Postal 2&quot;` these are referred to as `HTML entities`.\
`&quot;Postal 2&quot;` should render as `"Postal 2"` on the page, we are using [he](https://www.npmjs.com/package/he) to render them properly on the page.

Example :

```js
console.log( he.decode('foo &copy; bar &ne; baz &#x1D306; qux')) ;
// Output ‚Üí 'foo ¬© bar ‚â† baz ùåÜ qux'
```

### **Extra dependencies used**

- [react-confetti](https://github.com/alampros/react-confetti) : To render the Confetti that comes after the user finishes playing the game.
- [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) : 'react-confetti' requires 'react-use' to get the current windowSize.
- [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) : used for generating unique IDs.
